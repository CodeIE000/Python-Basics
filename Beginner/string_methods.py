# STRING METHODS

# Define:
# Method is something with a Dot operator ".upper()"
# Method is also known as a function.

# Demonstration Samples:
hello = 'heLLo'.upper()
print(hello)
hey = 'hEy'
print(hey.upper())
print(hello.lower())
print(hello.capitalize())
print(hello.count('LL'))
print(hello.count('ll'))
print(hello.lower().count('ll'))

# Note: Python is case sensitive

# Additional info for string multiplication:
x = 'hello '
y = 4
print(x * y)

# Concatenation:
z = 'yes'
print(x + z)
